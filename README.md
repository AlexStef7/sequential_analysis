# sequential_analysis
R scripts for the dissertation "Sequential Analysis Models and Applications", written in 2015 at the University of Piraeus.
The folder includes methods of sequential estimation and sequential hypothesis testing, based mainly on the book "Sequential Methods and Their Applications" (written by N.Mukhopadhyay).
You can find the details and the math behind the methods, by looking either at my thesis (in Greek) or the book.
