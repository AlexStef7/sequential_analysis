# sequential_analysis
R scripts for the dissertation "Sequential Analysis Models and Applications", written by Alexandros Stefanidis in 2015, at the University of Piraeus.
The folder includes methods of sequential estimation (sequential interval estimation) and sequential hypothesis testing for normal distributions, based mainly on the book "Sequential Methods and Their Applications" (written by N.Mukhopadhyay).
You can find the details and the math behind the methods, by looking either at my thesis (in Greek/or in English -> embedded at my Linkedin profile) or at the book.
